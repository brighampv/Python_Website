        <h2>Basic information on our project</h2>
        <p>In this analysis, we examined a dataset of chess games and their outcomes. We analyzed the factors leading to
          winning,
          as well as common behavior in games and in match-ups. We did this with the hope of finding ways to explain
          wins or find
          opportunities for more probable wins. We used only python programming, to create all of the visualizations on
          this website.</p>

        <h2>Summary of our Conclusions</h2>
        <p>Based upon this analysis, we can see that the rating system is not a perfect system to predict a winner.
          There are a number of confounding factors and a variety of game types. Upon playing a couple games of chess on
          the website, we discovered that the time limitation plays a large role in forcing people to resign rather than
          losing by running out of time. The platform will temporarily ban you if you do not resign before you run out
          of time.</p>
        <p>The rating system is also flawed because of the high number of games that occur by people who have not played
          very many games. A more accurate way of representing rating would be by including a confidence interval. Those
          that start at a score of 1500 may have a huge confidence interval. As they begin to play more games against
          other players that have established ratings, the confidence interval of the player’s rating will decrease.
          This also would be a way of telling if a player begins cheating. If they begin to win against players outside
          of their confidence interval, they could be temporarily banned from the site.</p>
        <p>By leveraging the opening moves data, we could also assign probabilities to winning to each player as the
          game progresses. Then, in the event of a draw or an out of time, rating points could be awarded based upon the
          progress of the game rather than a simple tie or win.</p>


        <h3>Chess characteristics that we analyzed</h3>
        <p><strong>What we looked for</strong></p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Wins vs. Color</dt>
          <dd>White won 50% of the time, black won 45% of the time, and the last 5% of games ended in a draw.</dd>
          <dt>Ratings vs. Turns</dt>
          <dd>We have found no correlation between the rating of players and how long they spend playing each game.</dd>
          <dt>Turns vs Victory Status - Automated</dt>
          <dd>We used ANOVA analysis and found that all significant comparisons were significant.</dd>
          <dt>Color of Winner vs Turns to Win</dt>
          <dd>We found that if black wins it would be with 60 turns whereas for white it is with only 56 turns.</dd>
          <dt>Expected Wins Based on Rating Difference</dt>
          <dd>we found that while player rating is significant, 64% of games were expected or normal based on player
            rating, whereas 36% of games caused an upset.</dd>
          <dt>Opening Move vs Turns to Win</dt>
          <dd>While many other opening sequences lead to either shorter or longer games, the Hippopota sequence leads to
            an abnormally short game.</dd>
